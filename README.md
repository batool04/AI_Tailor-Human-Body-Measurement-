# AI_Tailor-Human-Body-Measurement-
## Overview
This Human Body Measurement program is designed to automate the process of obtaining precise body measurements from images. The program utilizes a combination of advanced machine learning models and image processing techniques. The workflow involves three main steps:

## Image Segmentation:
Uses DeepLabV3, a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model powered by TensorFlow, to segment human figures from the background.
## 3D Body Construction:
Employs Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) to construct a 3D model of the human body from the segmented images.
## Measurement Extraction: 
Applies custom algorithms on the 3D model to calculate body measurements accurately.
This approach ensures that the measurements are not only automated but also accurate, catering to various applications such as tailored clothing, health monitoring, and virtual fitting rooms.
# Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main directories and files:

segmentation/: Contains the TensorFlow implementation for the DeepLabV3 model.
hmr/: Includes the HMR model setup for 3D body construction.
measurements/: Scripts to extract measurements from the 3D models.
src/: Utilities and configurations for model operations.
RunModel.py: A script that integrates the HMR model into the workflow.
main.py: The main script that orchestrates the segmentation, 3D construction, and measurement extraction.
